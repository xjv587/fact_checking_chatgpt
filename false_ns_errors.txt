Years later, when she was studying to become a teaching assistant, she opened up about her story in a homework essay. The head of staff read her work and asked her to deliver a speech to 120 teachers, during which some realised that their students might have experienced the same trauma. After reading Wardere's essay, school governor Clare Coghill booked Wardere appointments with other schools in the area. Wardere has worked as a mediator and FGM educator since then, helping young students escape FGM. She also delivers awareness raising sessions to doctors and the Police to assist in their understanding of FGM. Her testimonies have appeared in numerous publications, including the BBC, the "Guardian" and the "Telegraph". Wardere has advised that as an FGM survivor, she is aware many other women who have undergone the practice feel too ashamed to speak out about their suffering. Wardere is
